LOOK ROPE - "It looks okay. You've seen better." 

GET ROPE - "You attempt to take ye ROPE but alas it is enchanted! It glows a mustard red and smells like a public privy. The ROPE wraps round your neck and hangs you from parapets.

GO SOUTH - Takes you back to Main Dungeon Room. 


South of the Main Dungeon Room

LOOK/HELP (Before GET TRINKET) - "Ye stand yeself close to a yet-unnamed escarpment. Nonetheless, ye spies a TRINKET. Obvious exits are NORTH."

LOOK/HELP (After you try to GET TRINKET more than once) - "Thou hangeth out at an overlook. Obvious exits are NORTH. I shouldn't have to tell ye there is no TRINKET." 

GO NORTH - Takes you back to the Main Dungeon Room.

NOT DENNIS - Takes you back to the Main Dungeon Room. 

TALK - "You engage Dennis in leisurely discussion. Ye learns that his jimberjam was purchased on sale at a discount market and that he enjoys pacing about nervously. You become bored and begin thinking about parapets." 

LOOK DENNIS - "That jimberjam really makes the outfit." 

LOOK JIMBERJAM - "Man, that art a nice jimberjam." 

GIVE TRINKET (or GIVE TRINKET TO DENNIS) - "A novel idea! You givst the TRINKET to Dennis and he happily agrees to tell you what parapets are.

GIVE TRINKET (without actually having the TRINKET) - "Thou don'tst have a trinket to give. Go back to your tiny life."
